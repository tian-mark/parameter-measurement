This repository contains the code implementation for the paper "**Parameter measurement based on photometric images I: the method and the gas-phase metallicity of spiral galaxies**". The proposed method, Galaxy Parameter Measurement Residual Network (GPM-ResNet), uses deep learning to predict the gas-phase metallicity of galaxies from multi-band photometric images, primarily based on data from the DESI survey.

The code includes image pre-processing, model training, evaluation, pre-trained models and so on.

## Overview of the Paper
﻿
The gas-phase metallicity is a key parameter in understanding the evolution of galaxies. With the large-scale availability of multi-band galaxy images, it has become feasible to use these images as input data for predicting gas-phase metallicity. However, traditional methods often suffer from limited accuracy. This work proposes the **GPM-ResNet**, which employs a deep learning architecture to predict gas-phase metallicity from photometric images
